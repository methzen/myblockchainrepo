this repository is all about blockchain

How to run a blockchain exemple using python
In this python code we simulate the way blockchain work by 
creating a genesis block, creating nodes, 
making transactions and mining new blocks. 
All you have to do is run in a terminal like "python blockchain.py 5000", 
5000 being a arbitrary port for one node.
